Scoring Method (Free Version)
1.	Likert Items (1â€“5): Higher agreement = higher resistance, except balancing items (reverse scored).
2.	Forced-Choice Items: Score A or B based on resistance mapping.
3.	Total: Sum per archetype (3 items each).
4.	Result: Identify highest archetype â†’ show short free report.
Free Leadership Assessment â€“ Resistance Scoring
Step 1: Score Likert Items (1â€“5 scale)
â€¢	For each archetype question, assign points:
o	Strongly Disagree = 1
o	Disagree = 2
o	Neutral = 3
o	Agree = 4
o	Strongly Agree = 5
ðŸ‘‰ Balancing items (Q8, Q16, Q24) are reverse scored (Strongly Disagree = 5 â†’ Strongly Agree = 1).

Step 2: Score Forced-Choice Items
â€¢	Q4 (Decisive Change Agent):
o	A = 5 (high resistance)
o	B = 1 (low resistance)
â€¢	Q12 (Empowering Delegator):
o	A = 5 (resistance)
o	B = 1 (low resistance)
â€¢	Q20 (Outcome-Driven Achiever / Strategic Architect):
o	A = 5 (short-term bias, resistance)
o	B = 1 (long-term focus, balanced)

Step 3: Total Per Archetype
Each archetype has 3 questions. Max = 15 points, Min = 3 points.
â€¢	Strategic Architect: Q1, Q15, Q20 (B = low resistance, A = high)
â€¢	Vision-Driven Innovator: Q2, Q7, Q8 (reverse)
â€¢	Decisive Change Agent: Q3, Q4, Q18
â€¢	Collaborative Harmonizer: Q5, Q6, Q23
â€¢	Empowering Delegator: Q9, Q10, Q12
â€¢	People-Centric Coach: Q11, Q21, Q24 (reverse)
â€¢	Risk-Aware Stabilizer: Q13, Q14, Q16 (reverse)
â€¢	Outcome-Driven Achiever: Q17, Q19, Q20

**Step 4: Normalize to Resistance %
Convert raw scores (3â€“15) into a 0â€“100 resistance index:
Resistance%=(Rawâˆ’3)12Ã—100Resistance \% = \frac{(Raw - 3)}{12} \times 100Resistance%=12(Rawâˆ’3)Ã—100 
â€¢	Raw 3 = 0%
â€¢	Raw 15 = 100%

Step 5: Identify Dominant Archetype
â€¢	The archetype with the highest Resistance % = your primary resistance pattern.
â€¢	If tied: Choose the archetype with more forced-choice confirmation (Q4, Q12, Q20).

â€¢	Low Resistance: 0â€“34%
â€¢	Moderate Resistance: 35â€“54%
â€¢	High Resistance: 55â€“100%
