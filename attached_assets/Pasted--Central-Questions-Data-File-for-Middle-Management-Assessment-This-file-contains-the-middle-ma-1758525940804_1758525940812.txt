        "Your results show High Resistance (78%) in how you approach delegation, trust, and team ownership.\nAt your best, you are a manager who holds high standards. You care deeply about quality, know what “good work” looks like, and your attention to detail helps teams avoid costly mistakes. Senior leaders often trust you because your output is consistent and dependable.\nBut when resistance is high, these strengths narrow into control. Instead of empowering others, you may step in too often, recheck every detail, or redo work before it goes upward. To you, this feels like protecting quality — but to your team, it can feel like lack of trust. To senior leaders, it can create concerns about whether you can scale beyond individual contribution.\nThis pattern is called the Micromanager. It does not mean you lack leadership ability. It means your resistance shows up as over-investment in control. When balanced, your standards become an asset. But left unchecked, this pattern can block team growth, limit your promotability, and make it harder for you to step into broader leadership roles.",

You advocate for yourself, highlight your role in wins, and make sure senior leaders are aware of your contributions. This visibility often helps your career progression and signals ambition.\nBut when resistance is high, recognition becomes overemphasis. You may over-claim credit, spotlight your own role above the team’s, or focus more on how outcomes reflect on you than on collective progress. To you, this feels like protecting your visibility — but to your team, it can feel demotivating. To senior leaders, it may raise doubts about whether you can lead with maturity and collaboration.\nThis pattern is called the Credit Seeker. It does not mean you lack leadership value. It means your resistance shows up as leaning too heavily on visibility for personal advancement, which can undermine trust and slow your career growth.",
