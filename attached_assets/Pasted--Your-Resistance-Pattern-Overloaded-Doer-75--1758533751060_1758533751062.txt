🧠 First, Know This
Your results show High Resistance (75%) in how you approach workload, delegation, and personal responsibility.
At your best, you are a manager who leads by example. You work hard, step in when the team is stretched, and show a strong sense of responsibility. Teams admire your commitment, and senior leaders often view you as reliable and willing to “do what it takes.”
But when resistance is high, responsibility becomes overextension. You may take on too many tasks yourself, absorb work meant for others, or struggle to prioritize. To you, it feels like protecting the team or ensuring results — but to your direct reports, it signals you don’t trust them to deliver. To senior leaders, it raises questions about your scalability and ability to lead beyond your own effort.
This pattern is called the Overloaded Doer. It does not mean you lack leadership potential. It means your resistance shows up as doing instead of leading, which can stall your career growth and drain team initiative.

🔄 Core Behaviors Under Resistance
When resistance is high, Overloaded Doers often:

•	Measure commitment by how much they personally contribute.
•	Struggle to say “no,” even when overloaded.
•	Prioritize short-term delivery over building long-term team capacity.

🌱 Root Causes (Origins)
This resistance often develops in environments where output equaled credibility:
•	Early roles where being a “hard worker” was the main path to advancement.
•	Teams where doing more than others earned recognition.
•	Cultures that celebrated sacrifice and long hours over balance.
•	Experiences where delegating led to mistakes that reflected poorly on you.

•	“My value is measured in effort, not just outcomes.”
•	“Delegating slows things down.”
•	“Hard work is the only way to prove myself.”

👥 What Others Experience
•	Direct Reports: Respect your commitment but may feel underutilized or distrusted if you keep the hardest work for yourself.
•	Peers: Admire your work ethic but may see you as overwhelmed or scattered.
•	Senior Leaders: Value your reliability but may doubt your readiness for bigger roles if your success depends on personal effort rather than scalable leadership.

Strategic Practices
