Perfectionist Achiever
Immediate Shifts
•	Commit to finishing before perfecting — send the draft, then refine.
•	Use a timer (e.g., 25 minutes) to prevent endless editing.
•	When you hear “not ready yet,” pause and ask: Is this about quality, or fear of judgment?
Strategic Practices
•	Seek feedback at 70% complete instead of waiting until it feels flawless — this builds speed and reduces over-analysis.
•	Track where perfectionism caused delays, so the hidden costs are visible.
•	Practice “small imperfection reps” daily (e.g., share an unpolished idea in a meeting).
Long-Term Growth
•	Redefine success as consistent delivery, not flawless output.
•	Anchor your identity in adaptability and resilience — qualities that accelerate promotions more than polish.
•	Build a reputation as someone who drives momentum, showing others that credibility comes from results, not endless refining.

2. Helper / Over-Giver
Immediate Shifts
•	Say “yes” more carefully — try “yes, if…” to create boundaries.
•	Pause before helping and ask: Am I doing this out of genuine choice, or out of fear of disappointing?
•	Practice saying no once this week, framing it as prioritization, not rejection.
Strategic Practices
•	Track when over-giving leads to overload, resentment, or missed opportunities.
•	Use scripts for polite boundary-setting: “I’d love to help, but I need to finish X first.”
•	Role-play declining requests with a mentor or peer to normalize the discomfort.
Long-Term Growth
•	Reframe boundaries as an act of respect — for yourself and for others.
•	Anchor your identity in balanced contribution, not self-sacrifice.
•	Become known as a professional who is generous and discerning, earning respect instead of just appreciation.

3. Avoider
Immediate Shifts
•	Break avoided tasks into micro-steps — work for 5 minutes, then reassess.
•	Replace “I’ll do it later” with “I’ll start now, even a little.”
•	Notice avoidance moments and label them: This is resistance, not laziness.
Strategic Practices
•	Track what you avoid and what it costs (missed deadlines, stress spikes, lost credibility).
•	Use accountability structures: peer check-ins, visible task boards, or scheduled reminders.
•	Reflect weekly on what feelings you avoid (fear of failure, rejection, or conflict).
Long-Term Growth
•	Reframe avoidance as a signal of growth — the very task you avoid is where progress lives.
•	Anchor identity in reliability and follow-through.
•	Build a reputation as someone who faces discomfort directly, which positions you for leadership opportunities.

•	Make one faster decision daily — test “good enough” instead of waiting for perfect certainty.
•	When you want more data, ask: Do I need this to move forward, or am I stalling?
•	Say yes to one small, low-stakes risk this week.
Strategic Practices
•	Track how often analysis delayed action — make the hidden costs visible.
•	Pilot small experiments to practice safe risk-taking.
•	Pair with risk-tolerant peers to balance your caution with action.
Long-Term Growth
•	Reframe risk as learning, not danger.
•	Anchor identity in adaptability and decisiveness.

5. Independent Doer

•	Replace “I’ll handle it myself” with “Here’s how we can do this together.”
Strategic Practices
•	Track times independence caused rework, misalignment, or lost opportunities.
•	Build collaboration rituals: weekly syncs, shared documents, or project boards.
•	Intentionally partner with peers, even on tasks you could do alone.
Long-Term Growth
•	Reframe collaboration as efficiency, not weakness.
•	Anchor your identity in interdependence — trusted by others, not just self-reliant.
•	Build credibility as a team player who multiplies impact through connection, not just individual effort.

6. Recognition Seeker
Immediate Shifts
•	Give credit to someone else in every meeting.
•	Pause before sharing an achievement and ask: Am I informing, or am I fishing for approval?
•	Keep a private log of daily wins to build inner validation.
Strategic Practices
•	Balance self-promotion with peer-promotion — spotlight others as often as yourself.
•	Create visibility through measurable results, not reminders.
•	Seek mentorship and feedback to grow substance behind recognition.
Long-Term Growth
•	Reframe recognition as a byproduct of impact, not a goal.
•	Anchor identity in contribution and mastery.

7. Over-Controller
Immediate Shifts
•	Delegate one task fully without checking in.
•	Pause before stepping in and ask: Do they need help, or do I need control?
•	Replace directions with empowering questions: “What approach would you take?”
Strategic Practices
•	Track when control slowed progress or discouraged others.
•	Use feedback loops (peers, reports) to learn how your control is perceived.
•	Practice small “letting go” experiments to test trust in others’ capability.
Long-Term Growth
•	Reframe control as influence, not oversight.
•	Anchor identity in enabling others, not directing them.
•	Build credibility as a leader who multiplies trust, not one who bottlenecks results.

8. Comfort Zoner
Immediate Shifts
•	Say yes to one uncomfortable opportunity this week.
•	Replace “I’m not ready” with “I’ll try and learn as I go.”
•	Stretch your daily routine slightly — a new task, a new conversation, a new role.
Strategic Practices
•	Track when comfort slowed your career progress.
•	Create stretch goals: one new skill, one new responsibility, one new network.
•	Partner with peers who push you outside your safe zone.
Long-Term Growth
•	Reframe discomfort as evidence of growth.
•	Anchor identity in adaptability and resilience.
•	Build a reputation as someone who leans into challenge and inspires others to do the same.
