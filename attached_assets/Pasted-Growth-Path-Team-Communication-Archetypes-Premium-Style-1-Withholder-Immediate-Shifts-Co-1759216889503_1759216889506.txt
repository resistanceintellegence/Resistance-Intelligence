Growth Path — Team Communication Archetypes (Premium Style)

1. Withholder
Immediate Shifts
•	Commit to sharing one perspective in each meeting.
•	When silence feels safer, ask yourself: Am I protecting myself, or withholding value?
•	Replace “I’ll wait until asked” with “Here’s one thought I’d like to add.”
Strategic Practices
•	Track situations where withholding created missed clarity or direction.
•	Use structured turn-taking or “round robin” methods to practice safe participation.
•	Ask a trusted peer to nudge you when your input would help.
Long-Term Growth
•	Reframe contribution as responsibility, not risk.
•	Anchor your identity in candor and visible value.
•	Build a reputation as someone whose voice consistently shapes outcomes.

Strategic Practices
•	Track how guardedness affects group trust and collaboration.
•	Use regular check-ins to test sharing more than you normally would.
•	Create a “safe disclosure habit” — something small and consistent each week.
Long-Term Growth

•	Anchor your identity in transparency and trust-building.
•	Build a reputation as someone peers rely on for full, honest input.

4. Peacemaker

Strategic Practices
•	Track how often harmony was chosen over clarity.
•	Use respectful framing (“I see it differently because…”) to practice disagreement.
•	Role-play difficult conversations to build confidence.
Long-Term Growth

8. Over-Adapter
Immediate Shifts
•	Voice your authentic stance once in each meeting.
•	Pause before shifting your view — ask: Am I adapting for harmony, or diluting my perspective?
•	Replace “I agree” with “I see it slightly differently.”
Strategic Practices
•	Track how often adaptation diluted your clarity.

•	Use respectful dissent phrases to stay authentic while engaging others.
Long-Term Growth
•	Reframe authenticity as influence, not risk.
•	Anchor your identity in confidence and integrity.
