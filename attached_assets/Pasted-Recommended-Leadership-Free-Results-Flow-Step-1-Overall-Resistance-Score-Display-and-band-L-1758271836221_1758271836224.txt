Recommended Leadership Free Results Flow
Step 1 – Overall Resistance Score
•	Display % and band (Low, Moderate, High).
•	Example: “Your overall resistance score is 61% (High). Resistance patterns are clearly shaping how you approach leadership decisions.”
Step 2 – Top 3 Archetypes
•	List each archetype with % score.
•	Add 2–3 sentence mini-analysis (like we did for Mid-level Free).
•	Example:
o	Strategic Architect (72%) → You bring clarity and structure, but resistance shows up as rigidity and over-control. This slows bold moves and limits delegation.
o	Decisive Change Agent (68%) → You create urgency, but resistance pushes you into overdrive, moving faster than others can follow.
o	Collaborative Harmonizer (63%) → You unite people, but resistance makes you avoid candor in high-stakes forums, leaving risks unspoken.

Strategic Architect
You bring clarity and order to complex problems. When resistance is high, this becomes rigidity. You may slow bold moves, delay pivots, or hold too much control yourself. Teams can feel dependent on your sign-off rather than empowered.
2. Vision-Driven Innovator
You inspire bold ideas and see opportunities others miss. When resistance is high, vision turns into overprotection. You may hold concepts too tightly, delay launches, or resist input. This can stall execution and frustrate peers.
3. Decisive Change Agent
You create urgency and momentum in times of disruption. When resistance is high, this becomes overdrive. You may push shifts too quickly, bypass input, and exhaust teams. Stakeholders may begin to question sustainability.
4. Collaborative Harmonizer
You unite people and foster alignment. When resistance is high, harmony becomes avoidance. You may hold back dissent, endorse consensus too quickly, or soften conflict. This leaves risks unspoken and reduces decisiveness.
5. Empowering Delegator
You grow people by giving ownership. When resistance is high, empowerment becomes disengagement. You may step back too far, avoid oversight, or fail to clarify expectations. Teams may feel abandoned and results can slip.
6. People-Centric Coach
You invest deeply in developing talent. When resistance is high, coaching becomes overextension. You may hold onto underperformers, delay tough calls, or over-prioritize individuals at the expense of enterprise needs.
7. Risk-Aware Stabilizer
You safeguard the organization with vigilance. When resistance is high, caution becomes over-caution. You may slow decisions, challenge bold ideas, or default to the status quo. Opportunities are often missed in the name of safety.
8. Outcome-Driven Achiever
You drive accountability and results relentlessly. When resistance is high, focus narrows to short-term wins. You may create fatigue, overlook innovation, or sacrifice sustainability. Success can come at the cost of long-term value.
