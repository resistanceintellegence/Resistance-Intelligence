1 Micromanager (3)
1.	Even after assigning tasks, I often review or adjust details before I feel comfortable.
2.	A team member submits solid work that isn’t exactly my style. My instinct is to:
o	A) Approve it as-is to recognize their ownership
o	B) Rework sections so it aligns with my preferred approach
3.	I make a conscious effort to give team members full ownership, even if the results differ from my style. (balancing)
Bottleneck Manager (3)
4. I prefer to keep key approvals centralized with me rather than distributed across the team.
5. Senior leadership asks for a quick turnaround. I am most likely to:
•	A) Ask my team to proceed while I catch up on details later
•	B) Delay action until I can personally review and sign off
6.	I actively create systems so projects can progress without waiting for me. (balancing)
Firefighter (3)
7. I often find myself jumping into urgent issues even when long-term projects need attention.
8. When I’m praised for my work, it’s usually for:
•	A) Solving immediate problems under pressure
•	B) Driving steady, long-term improvements
9.	I make space in my schedule for preventative improvements, even when urgent needs compete. (balancing)
Overloaded Doer (3)
10. I often take on tasks myself because it feels faster than explaining them.
11. When deadlines are tight, I am more likely to:
•	A) Step in and do the work myself
•	B) Rely on my team, even if it risks delays or mistakes
12.	I regularly review my workload and reassign tasks so I don’t carry more than my share. (balancing)
Conflict Avoider (3)
13. In tense discussions, I tend to smooth things over rather than push my own perspective strongly.
14. A team member consistently misses deadlines. I am most likely to:
•	A) Delay confrontation, hoping they self-correct
•	B) Address the issue directly, even if it creates tension
15.	I believe constructive conflict, when handled well, strengthens trust and performance. (balancing)
Credit Seeker (3)
16. I make sure senior leaders are aware of my role in team successes.
17. A project succeeds because of teamwork. When sharing results upward, I am most likely to:
•	A) Highlight my leadership role
•	B) Spotlight the team’s efforts more than my own
18.	I actively redirect recognition toward my team when they drive success. (balancing)
Detached Manager (3)
19. I tend to stay focused on tasks and results more than the emotional dynamics of my team.
20. A team member seems disengaged. My instinct is to:
•	A) Assume they’ll speak up if important
•	B) Ask questions to explore what’s affecting their work
21.	I make an effort to connect personally with team members so they feel supported beyond tasks. (balancing)
Rule-Bound Operator (3)
22. I prefer to follow established procedures rather than adapt them on the spot.
23. Senior leadership asks for a quick solution that bends procedure. I am most likely to:
•	A) Stick to the rules to ensure consistency
•	B) Adapt quickly, even if it means breaking the rules
24.	I view rules as guidelines that can be adapted when circumstances require flexibility. (balancing)

✨ Why This Works
•	24 total questions (3 per archetype).
•	Still balanced across all 8 archetypes.
•	Free version = quick snapshot.
•	Paid version = deeper diagnostic (80 Qs, full reports, resistance costs, growth path).
________________________________________
________________________________________
1. Question–Archetype Mapping
•	Each of the 8 archetypes has 3 questions.
•	Q1–Q3 = Micromanager
•	Q4–Q6 = Bottleneck Manager
•	Q7–Q9 = Firefighter
•	Q10–Q12 = Overloaded Doer
•	Q13–Q15 = Conflict Avoider
•	Q16–Q18 = Credit Seeker
•	Q19–Q21 = Detached Manager
•	Q22–Q24 = Rule-Bound Operator
________________________________________
2. Response Scoring
•	All questions are scored 1–5 (Likert scale).
•	For multiple-choice or forced-choice, assign:
o	A = 5 points (resistance response)
o	B = 1 point (low-resistance response)
•	Reverse-scored (balancing) items → flip scale (so “high agreement” = low resistance).
________________________________________
3. Archetype Scores
•	Each archetype = sum of 3 Qs (max 15 points).
•	Convert to % for consistency:
o	(Archetype Score ÷ 15) × 100
________________________________________
4. Resistance Bands
•	0–30% = Low Resistance
•	31–50% = Moderate Resistance
•	51–100% = High Resistance
(same structure as Leadership, but scaled for shorter test)
________________________________________
Resistance Scoring Model (Free Version – 24 Questions)
1. Item Scoring
•	Normal items: Stronger agreement with resistance behavior = higher score.
•	Forced-choice items:
o	Option A (resistant behavior) = 5 points
o	Option B (balanced behavior) = 1 point
•	Balancing items (reverse-coded): flip scoring (e.g., “I make space for preventative improvements…” → Strongly Agree = 1, Strongly Disagree = 5).
________________________________________
2. Archetype Scores
•	Each archetype = 3 questions × 1–5 points = 3–15 range.
•	Convert to percentage:
Archetype % = (Raw ÷ 15) × 100
________________________________________
3. Overall Resistance Score
•	Total Raw Score = Sum of all 24 Qs (max 120).
•	Convert to percentage:
Resistance % = (Total ÷ 120) × 100
________________________________________
4. Resistance Bands (for Free)
Keep it simple + credible, but a bit stricter than Leadership:
•	0–30% = Low Resistance → Very adaptive, rarely blocked by resistance.
•	31–50% = Moderate Resistance → Resistance shows up situationally; mixed profile.
•	51–100% = High Resistance → Clear patterns shaping how you lead; strong archetypes visible.




Architypes Description:
  Middle Management Archetypes



Micromanager
You set high standards and ensure work meets your expectations. When resistance is high, this turns into double-checking or reworking others’ efforts, which slows execution. Teams may deliver less independently if they sense you don’t fully let go.
2. Bottleneck Manager
You want quality and control before decisions move forward. When resistance is high, approvals stall and projects back up, leaving others waiting. Over time, this can create frustration and reduce momentum across your team.
3. Firefighter
You thrive in urgency and handle crises quickly. When resistance is high, reacting to problems overshadows preventing them, leaving your team stuck in “fix-it mode.” Long-term priorities often get delayed while short-term fires dominate.
4. Overloaded Doer
You lead by example and show strong commitment through hard work. When resistance is high, you take on too much yourself, which creates burnout and limits your team’s growth. This makes results depend too heavily on your effort.
5. Conflict Avoider
You keep relationships smooth and create a calm environment. When resistance is high, you hold back feedback or avoid tension, which weakens accountability. Issues linger longer than they should, eroding trust and performance.
6. Credit Seeker
You ensure achievements don’t go unnoticed and highlight your role in success. When resistance is high, recognition leans too much toward self-promotion, which can frustrate peers and demotivate your team. Leaders may question your maturity in collaboration.
7. Detached Manager
You stay focused on tasks and results, keeping boundaries clear. When resistance is high, this becomes emotional distance, leaving team members feeling unseen or undervalued. Engagement and loyalty may slip as a result.
8. Rule-Bound Operator
You respect structure and processes, ensuring fairness and consistency. When resistance is high, strict rules slow progress and limit adaptability. Teams may feel stifled when flexibility is needed for speed or innovation.
