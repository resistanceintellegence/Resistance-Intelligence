​You​
Micromanager
⚡ What High Resistance Looks Like
Under pressure, guidance turns into control. You re-do work, override decisions, and require frequent check-ins. Speed from above and variability below push you to become the single source of truth. This creates delays and drains initiative.
👥 What Others Experience
Direct reports: Disempowered, second-guessed, slow to act without your approval.
Peers: Workstreams stall while you “review.” Collaboration feels like clearance.
Senior leaders: Question scalability and strategic altitude. See a bottleneck, not a builder of capacity.
⛔ Bottleneck Manager
⚡ What High Resistance Looks Like
Decision rights collapse to you. Approvals pile up, priorities stay ambiguous, and risks sit unresolved because everything routes through your desk. The system slows even when the team is capable. Nothing moves without you.
👥 What Others Experience
Direct reports: Waiting, context-switching, missed deadlines caused by stalled approvals.
Peers: Coordination jams and dependencies linger. Frustration builds around “the queue.”
Senior leaders: See delivery risk and single-point-of-failure concerns. Doubt your ability to scale scope.
🚨 Firefighter
⚡ What High Resistance Looks Like
Urgency eclipses strategy. You chase the loudest flames, reward heroics, and normalize after-hours saves instead of fixing root causes. The team runs hot. The same fires keep returning.
👥 What Others Experience
Direct reports: Burnout, whiplash priorities, little time for deep work or improvement.
Peers: Constant escalations and unplanned asks disrupt their work.
Senior leaders: See low predictability and weak fundamentals. Question your systems thinking.
📦 Overloaded Doer
⚡ What High Resistance Looks Like
You take it all on. Saying yes keeps work safe but crowds out leadership. Delegation slips, coaching time vanishes, and your calendar becomes the constraint. Output is high until it breaks.
👥 What Others Experience
Direct reports: Under-utilized, under-developed, waiting for meaningful ownership.
Peers: Hard to coordinate with. Commitments slip when your bandwidth snaps.
Senior leaders: See a capacity ceiling and succession risk. Doubt your ability to scale through others.
🤐 Conflict Avoider
⚡ What High Resistance Looks Like
Tough calls soften. Performance issues linger, trade-offs blur, and feedback arrives late or not at all. Harmony today creates larger friction tomorrow. Standards erode, misalignment grows, and resentment builds quietly.
👥 What Others Experience
Direct reports: Confusion about expectations. Chronic issues never resolved.
Peers: Misalignment continues. Decisions feel partial or reversible.
Senior leaders: Concern about your ability to manage performance and enforce standards.
🏆 Credit Seeker
⚡ What High Resistance Looks Like
Visibility outruns value. You narrate your impact, center yourself in wins, and over-optimize for recognition. The team’s contributions fade. Trust with peers thins. Leaders question the signal compared to the substance.
👥 What Others Experience
Direct reports: Demotivated when recognition flows upward. Reluctant to go the extra mile.
Peers: Guarded in collaboration. Worry about attribution and fairness.
Senior leaders: Skeptical about team health and authenticity. Doubt your enterprise mindset.
🧊 Detached Manager
⚡ What High Resistance Looks Like
Presence drops. One-to-ones slip, coaching becomes transactional, and you operate from the edges. Issues surface late and momentum fades. The team delivers but connection and direction feel thin.
👥 What Others Experience
Direct reports: Feel unsupported and underdeveloped. Engagement weakens.
Peers: Hard to align with. Responsiveness drops when coordination is needed.
Senior leaders: Read you as disengaged or stretched. Question your readiness to lead through change.
📏 Rule-Bound Operator
⚡ What High Resistance Looks Like
Process hardens into rigidity. You default to policy, resist exceptions, and stall adaptation when conditions shift. Compliance is high but agility is low.
👥 What Others Experience
Direct reports: Initiative stifled. Creativity feels punished.
Peers: See you as an obstacle during change or cross-functional projects.
Senior leaders: Concern you cannot pivot fast enough for transformation or growth.
