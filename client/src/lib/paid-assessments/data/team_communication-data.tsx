    allMedium: `
      üß† What This Means
      Your results show moderate resistance across all communication archetypes. This means no single pattern dominates your style, but you may experience friction in multiple ways depending on context. Sometimes you hold back, other times you accommodate too much, or you shift tone to reduce tension. None of these tendencies are extreme, but together they create inconsistency.
      üìä Resistance Profile: Medium Across All
      At this level, your communication style is adaptable but not always reliable. You have the ability to flex, but resistance can still slow trust and reduce clarity if left unchecked.
      üîÑ What This Looks Like in Teams
      ¬∑ Speaking up sometimes, staying silent at other times.
      ¬∑ Balancing between cooperation and control, without full consistency.
      ¬∑ Occasional avoidance of conflict or tough conversations.
      ¬∑ Flexibility that can feel unpredictable to others.
      ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk of Staying Here
      Moderate resistance can be harder to spot than extremes ‚Äî but it still impacts results. Teams may find it difficult to know which ‚Äúversion‚Äù of you will show up in a meeting. This unpredictability can erode trust over time.
      üöÄ Growth Path
      To move forward:
      ¬∑ Identify which archetype patterns appear most often under stress.
      ¬∑ Build consistency by practicing one clear communication habit (e.g., always voicing one perspective in meetings).
      ¬∑ Use reflection questions to spot when flexibility becomes avoidance.
      ¬∑ Work with micro-learning prompts to target your most frequent resistance pattern.
    `,
    mixedMediumLow: `
      üß† What This Means
      Your results show a blend of low resistance in some archetypes and moderate resistance in others. This means you have clear communication strengths, but a few patterns still create friction in certain situations.
      üìä Resistance Profile: Mixed Medium + Low
      At this level, most of your communication supports collaboration, but there are specific blind spots. Instead of being a general communication challenge, your growth focus is about sharpening and balancing.
      üîÑ What This Looks Like in Teams
      ¬∑ Strong communication strengths in some areas (e.g., openness, humor, or harmony).
      ¬∑ A few recurring friction points (e.g., hesitation to share concerns, tendency to over-accommodate).
      ¬∑ Generally seen as reliable, but occasional struggles under pressure.
      ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk of Staying Here
      Colleagues may see you as effective most of the time, but notice inconsistencies in certain contexts (e.g., conflict-heavy meetings, high-stakes projects). These ‚Äúblind spots‚Äù may limit advancement into leadership roles where consistent communication is critical.
      üöÄ Growth Path
      To move forward:
      ¬∑ Celebrate your low-resistance strengths ‚Äî they are real assets.
      ¬∑ Focus on the 1‚Äì2 archetypes where resistance shows up moderately.
      ¬∑ Use micro-learning prompts to practice those specific growth edges.
      ¬∑ Reinforce balance by asking trusted colleagues for feedback on those blind spots.
    `,
    allLow: `
      üß† What This Means
      Your results show low resistance across all archetypes. This means you communicate with openness, consistency, and adaptability. You are able to share your perspective, balance conflict with harmony, and remain engaged without slipping into unhelpful patterns.
      üìä Resistance Profile: Low Across All
      At this level, resistance rarely interferes with your team communication. Your style is collaborative, reliable, and constructive.
      üîÑ What This Looks Like in Teams
      ¬∑ You contribute consistently without dominating or withdrawing.
      ¬∑ You balance honesty with empathy.
      ¬∑ You help teams stay on track without silencing voices.
      ¬∑ You adapt in ways that build trust rather than avoid conflict.
      ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk of Staying Here
      Low resistance does not mean no growth needed. Your strength is consistency, but if you rely on it too much, you may overlook subtle improvements ‚Äî like learning when to be more forceful, or when to let others lead.
      üöÄ Growth Path
      To maximize your strengths:
      ¬∑ Use your clear communication as a model for others.
      ¬∑ Mentor peers who struggle with high-resistance patterns.
      ¬∑ Refine influence skills ‚Äî move from effective communicator to trusted leader.
      ¬∑ Expand by linking communication strengths with career development and leadership readiness.
